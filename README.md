# Final Greenfoot Project

This project is a card fighting game where you play Roland, and have to defeat Argalia as many times as possible. Each time he is defeated he gets stronger.

The controls are buttons 1-9 and enter to start the game and initiate combat. Red dice are offensive attacks, blue dice are defensive moves, which both roll between the two numbers beside.
